Working with Lists in Python
Review
15 min

In this lesson, we learned how to:

    Add elements to a list by index using the .insert() method.
    Remove elements from a list by index using the .pop() method.
    Generate a list using the range() function.
    Get the length of a list using the len() function.
    Select portions of a list using slicing syntax.
    Count the number of times that an element appears in a list using the .count() method.
    Sort a list of items using either the .sort() method or sorted() function.

As you go through the exercises, feel free to use print() to see changes when not explicitly asked to do so.
Instructions

    Checkpoint 1 Passed

    1.

    Our friend Jiho has been so successful in both the flower and grocery business that she has decided to open a furniture store.

    Jiho has compiled a list of inventory items into a list called inventory and wants to know a few facts about it.

    First, how many items are in the warehouse?

    Save the answer to a variable called inventory_len.

Checkpoint 2 Passed

2.

Select the first element in inventory. Save it to a variable called first.
Checkpoint 3 Passed

3.

Select the last element from inventory. Save it to a variable called last.
Checkpoint 4 Passed

4.

Select items from the inventory starting at index 2 and up to, but not including, index 6.

Save your answer to a variable called inventory_2_6.
Checkpoint 5 Passed

5.

Select the first 3 items of inventory. Save it to a variable called first_3.
Checkpoint 6 Passed

6.

How many 'twin bed's are in inventory? Save your answer to a variable called twin_beds.
Checkpoint 7 Passed

7.

Remove the 5th element in the inventory. Save the value to a variable called removed_item.
Checkpoint 8 Passed

8.

There was a new item added to our inventory called "19th Century Bed Frame".

Use the .insert() method to place the new item as the 11th element in our inventory.
Checkpoint 9 Passed

9.

Sort inventory using the .sort() method or the sorted() function.

Remember, the sorted() function doesn’t change the original list — it creates a new list with the elements properly sorted. If you use sorted() you’ll have to set inventory equal to the value returned by sorted().

Print inventory to see the result.
